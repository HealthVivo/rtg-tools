Evaluation too complex (50002 unresolved paths, 189621 iterations) at reference region 11:3795-3836. Variants in this region will not be included in results.
There were 2 variants not thresholded in ROC data files due to missing or invalid GQ (FORMAT) values.
Not enough ROC data to maximize F-measure, only un-thresholded statistics will be computed. Consider selecting a different scoring attribute with --vcf-score-field
